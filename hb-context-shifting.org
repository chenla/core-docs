* Introduction

It's important to teach both managers and creative people the
importance of the costs of context switching.

This is something we need to stress in chalkhall as well, as a general
principle that applies to any task.  It doesn't even have to be
mental, physical tasks entail context switching as well.

Kathy Sierra has some good points as well, despite repeatedly using
the weasel word /mindfulness/ thoughout the posts.

Jeff Atwood of coding horror fame, quoted this [[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4471607.stm][BBC study]]:

#+begin_quote
The study, carried out at the Institute of Psychiatry, found excessive
use of technology reduced workers' intelligence. Those distracted by
incoming email and phone calls saw a 10-point fall in their IQ - more
than twice that found in studies of the impact of smoking marijuana,
said researchers.

For this reason, I think it's important to always have sysadmins
either working on projects, or doing customer triage.  This ensures
that sysadmins have blocks of time to do complex tasks that require
extended concentration.

This goes back to Paul Graham's [[http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html][manager and maker schedules]] -- I would
extend that to six broader catagories that are divided into /negotium/
which is anything that interacts with others, and /otium/ which is
solitary and contemplative in nature.

** Negotium

*Social* which are any tasks that require interaction with other
people, this broadly includes management, but also includes meetings,
customer service, and answering questions and discussion.  So time
spent in IRC, Slack, Facebook as well as SCRUM standups, telephone
calls and chatting while getting coffee are all in this category.

*Task* is time spent on relatively short and well defined tasks that
don't require a lot of research, concentration or effort.  Tasks are a
kind of rest, keeping your hands and attention busy which allows your
brain to work on Maker and Mastering tasks subconsciously.

*Play* is any activity that is physically or mentally engaging that is
an end in itself, often together with others.  Play can be anything
from a game of chess, to playing volleyball with coworkers after work,
to going to the cinema, a bar (though this often overlaps with social
activities), playing darts, playing with your children or even having
sex.  When play is done as a solitary activity, it overlaps with Rest.

** Otium

*Maker* is time spent on anything that requires an extended amount of
time to load into your brain, and concentrate on.  This time needs to
be the most protected because the cost of interruptions is so
expensive.

*Mastering* deliberate practice is similar to Maker time, but is
concerned more with the process of mastering something rather than
making something new.

*Rest* include any solitary activity that allows your brain and body
to recharge.  This includes everything from naps, deep sleep, zoning
out and watching the traffic, river or ocean with a beer or cup of tea
or coffee.  It might be long walks, playing the ukelele, or even more
strenuous excercise like running, fishing, mountain climbing,
gardening etc.
