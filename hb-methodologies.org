* Introduction

It is said that every time the term /Agile/ is spoken aloud,
an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsara][Apsara]] sheds a tear.  Since I am the last person to wish
to diminish the mental state of any Apasara (it is hard to
be a temptress when one is sad) I will try to keep the
damage to a minimum.

Chenla & b>i do not proscribe /any/ development
methodologies.  Every project is free to concoct the
methodologies that they find work best.

However, there are a lot of a good ideas in Agile,
Scrum and Kanban which, if used judiciously, can be very
helpful to development teams.

This document is meant to cherry pick the collection of
methodologies and strategies that we will be testing in
development projects.  Some things will work, others won't.

Over time this document will detail what works for us and
why, what what didn't work for us and what to avoid.

It should be kept in mind that many Agile and Scrum
practices are based on the assumption that teams are
physically located in the same place.

Successful companies who are distributed and remote, tend to
use some Agile practices, but are not religious about it.

This document is very much a work in progress!

* Agile
* Scrum

** Sprints
** Standup Meetings

A great deal of emphasis in Agile & Scrum is placed on the
idea of /face to face meetings/.  

*** Standup Meeting Size

Important to keep number of people no larger than 6-7. even
virtually.

** Sprint Reviews


* User Stories

 - Let's use orgfile templates for User Stories together
   with some CSS to create a page for user stories for each
   project.

**  Task Boards & Story Maps  

Storymaps help to visualize the backlog in context with how
each story fits into the broader development picture.  It
helps you see the big picture forest and where all the trees
are within the forest.

Story maps are organzied Stories in priority order from
highest to lowest priority.

With all stories that fit within a milestone release listed
together.

Kanban (task boards), which are simular to but not the same as
storyboards.  Kanban shows the features/stories that are
being worked on in a given sprint -- whereas story maps
focus on what features/stories will be included in each
stage of development.
