Chenla dose not proscribe /any/ development methodologies.
Every project is free to concoct the methodologies that they
find work best.

An excellent example of staying out of the way is that when
teams were formed at Automattic, a major question was how
they should collaborate. At first everyone stayed with P2s,
IRC, and Skype purely out of inertia, but soon teams, on
their own, tried new things. One team switched to Skype
video. Another tried Google Hangouts. There was no official
mandate or policy. Each employee, and each team, decided
which tools to try and which to keep. The tools were never
of primary importance, although Toni and Matt made clear we
had their support to buy the ones we needed and try them
out. But what always mattered most was went on in each
employee's mind. We were trusted to figure out which tools
supported our work styles individually and as teams. There
was never a mandate not to use e-mail. People simply found
that the combination of P2s and IRC solved most needs, so
that's what they used. Had a team wanted to try being
e-mail-centric, it could have.

11.3 On Writing Manuals

I guess most manuals are written after-the-fact; documenting
a program that’s already there. This is not how this manual
is written. When implementing something, I write the manual
entry for that something straight away. I then see that it’s
difficult to explain the functionality, so I write how it’s
supposed to be, and then I change the
implementation. Writing the documentation and writing the
code go hand in hand.

This, of course, means that this manual has no, or little,
flow. It documents absolutely everything in Gnus, but often
not where you’re looking for it. It is a reference manual,
and not a guide to how to get started with Gnus.

That would be a totally different book, that should be
written using the reference manual as source material. It
would look quite different.
