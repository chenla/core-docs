* Introduction

* Shearing Model

Gibson said it -- the future is already here, it's just not evenly
distributed

People today don't understand shearing -- they think everything is
happening at the same speed -- that everything is simultaneous --
there is no separation of layers -- it's all a firehose that doesn't
give you a chance to think about the next hour, let alone tomorrow.



fast -> slow

firehose -> otium

* Internal Communications

always use plain text -- if you /must/ send formated messages, you
multipart mime (plain text and html)

* Devices

Devices and the limitations that they impose on what they can be used
to read and respond to communications belong to different shearing
layers -- don't try to use the wrong device/interface to work in the
wrong shearing layer.

Don't use a device to communicate that isn't appropriate to the type
of communication.

mobile         --> short form
desktop/laptop --> long form

* Etiquette



* Communication Channels
