* Introduction

* Shearing Model

Gibson said it -- the future is already here, it's just not evenly
distributed

People today don't understand shearing -- they think everything is
happening at the same speed -- that everything is simultaneous --
there is no separation of layers -- it's all a firehose that doesn't
give you a chance to think about the next hour, let alone tomorrow.




In the United States there used to be a concept of a conservative --
someone who is concerned about conservation, maintaining stability,
continuity and protecting what is valuable.  No longer -- the word now
refers to a concept of commerce as being at the same level as fashion
-- grab what you can, as fast as you can and damn the consequences.


fast -> slow

firehose -> otium
