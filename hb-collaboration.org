* Introduction

This will be the /Chenla Collaboration Team Handbook/

* Introduction

Chenla Documentation is structured in a simular way that Org's
=Worg=.  All documentation is written in =literate orgmode= and
maintained in a Git repository on the team =gitolite= server.  But it
is also mirrored in a public repo on [[gh:deerpig][GitHub]].  The website, code and
documention for the project is generated from this repo and deployed
on the project web server.  Anyone can clone a copy of the repo, make
changes and contributions and then put in a pull request to have them
integrated into the main trunk.

Git version control is obviously an important part of this process,
but Git is not a very good way of multiple people editing the same
text.  But this we use CriticMarkup.  If you edit an existing piece of
text, use CriticMarkup using =cm-mode= in emacs or criticmarkup support
in a number of other editors and then commit the the marked up file to
be reviewed and the changes intregrated into the site.

* Chelpa: Chenla Elpa Mirror Repository

To keep everyone's emacs in sync, so that there are no problems with
deployment, or with dependencies, we run our own Elpa Mirror =CHELPA=.

* UsePackage

The team maintains an init file named =.emacs-chenla= that includes
usepackage statements that point to all of the packages that are
needed to create, build and export.


* Critic Markup

** Markup

- Addition ={++ ++}=
- Deletion ={-- --}=
- Substitution ={~~ ~> ~~}=
- Comment ={>> <<}=
- Highlight ={== ==}{>> <<}=
